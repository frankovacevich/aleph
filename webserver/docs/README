This docs are available to your users on the Web server. You should edit the docs
to suit your application.

To build the docs you will need to have sphinx installed:
```
pip3 install sphinx
pip3 install myst-parser
pip3 install sphinx-rtd-theme
```

Then you can build the html docs running (from the webserver folder):
```
python3 -m sphinx -b html ./docs ./docs/_build/html
```
